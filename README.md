## Approach 🚶
The project uses React for the frontend, with React Router for navigation. Face-api.js is used for facial recognition, integrated with the webcam for capturing user images. The application follows a component-based architecture, with separate components for user registration, login, and authentication.

Key features include:
- Multi-step user registration with facial image capture
- Secure storage of facial descriptors using encryption
- Real-time face detection and matching for authentication
- Integration with Firebase for data storage and retrieval

The code follows modern React practices, utilizing hooks for state management and side effects. Error handling and loading states are implemented to enhance user experience.

## Status 📶
The project is currently in active development. Core functionalities are implemented, but there's ongoing work to improve performance, security, and user experience.
